<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Flutterfire came up with a idea to let people stay productive in all this covid times. We created an platform where people can come up with a group and compete with each other.
Do you also have trouble getting up in the morning? Or do you find it difficult to do boring work all by yourself? If yes, then GetSetPRO is one stop destination for you. From developing an important skill, to doing a boring job, it allows your friends to help you in achieve a common goal together. This app helps you grow little by little each day. Think of it as a social to-do app where instead of daily updates of your friend in forms of images/videos to get to see their common daily task and imagine if you can also see what your peers are doing and what is helping them grow. But you should not only spectate the show but join this exciting journey right away. Invite some friends from your space, fix some task and do it daily. Check the progress and incrementally grow each day little by little. Now when you achieve a goal share it on your social media on your wall in the app and inspire others to do difficult task.
* Daily growth projector

## About Flutterfire
We are a beginners team with 2 member participating for the first time. We came up with this idea by having a conversation with each other on how can we stay productive and 
focused during all this time of pandemic and can compete with each other the way we did in college in every other field we were interested in.
